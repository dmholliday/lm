Hello and thank you for the opportunity to write some example code for you guys!

In the included folders you'll find the code for the two tasks, including binaries and Makefiles if necessary.

Task 1 is in the barcode folder and Task 2 is in the database folder.

These were fun to learn how to some things in C that I haven't done before.  I've done similar things in Python, but never C.

Task 1 was tested by running a local netcat session and sending strings to the client once it connects.

Task 2 was tested by creating a local MySQL database with the same schema showed in the document you guys emailed to me and running queries on it.

I hope that I've shown that on top of the huge amount of industrial controls knowledge and skills that I have, I can also do a little bit of software as well!

I look forward to hearing back from you guys!

Take care,

Dustin
